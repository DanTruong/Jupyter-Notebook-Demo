The purpose of this demo document is to show the capabilities of Python towards performing hypothesis testing. The hypothesis.ipynb file contains the code and text that explains the context of the data. If opened up in Jupyter Notebook, you should then be able to export it to MD or PDF format (via LaTeX). 

For a test example, we'll look at a hypothetical scenario where the effect of ascorbic acid is evaluated against the common cold. The data is based on a 1961 experiment where 279 French skiers were given either ascorbic acid or a placebo. After two weeks, they were examined to determine if they still had symptoms of the cold. 

| Treatment     | Cold | No Cold | Total |
|---------------|------|---------|-------|
| Placebo       | 31   | 109     | 140   |
| Ascorbic Acid | 17   | 122     | 139   |
| Total         | 48   | 231     | 279   |



## Defining the Null and Alternative Hypothesis

To define the null and alternative hypotheses, we must frame them off of what we are looking to investigate. As defined above, we want to see how effective Ascorbic Acid is in preventing cold symptoms (link between ascorbic acid and cold symptoms). Because this is a case-control experiment, we'll define the case as those that have cold symptoms and the control as those without. Let P1 be the amount of Ascorbic Acid user that are afflicted with the cold and P2 without.

* H0: P1 = P2
* H1: P1 != P2

## Generate Expected Distribution


```python
# Observed Distribution Array
obs = {
    "a" : 17, ## Ascorbic Acid Treatment, Cold Symptoms 
    "b" : 31, ## Placebo Treatment, Cold Symptoms
    "c" : 122, ## Ascorbic Acid Treatment, No Cold Symptoms
    "d" : 109 ## Placebo Treatment, No Cold Symptoms
}

n = sum(obs.values()) ## Sum of participants

aEXP = (obs['a'] + obs['b']) * (obs['a'] + obs['c']) / n
bEXP = (obs['a'] + obs['b']) * (obs['b'] + obs['d']) / n
cEXP = (obs['c'] + obs['d']) * (obs['a'] + obs['c']) / n
dEXP = (obs['c'] + obs['d']) * (obs['b'] + obs['d']) / n

## Expected Distribution Array
exp = {
    "Ascorbic Acid Treatment, Cold Symptoms" : aEXP,
    "Placebo Treatment, Cold Symptoms" : bEXP,
    "Ascorbic Acid Treatment, No Cold Symptoms" : cEXP,
    "Placebo Treatment, No Cold Symptoms" : dEXP
}

import pprint
pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent = 3).pprint(exp)
```

    {  'Ascorbic Acid Treatment, Cold Symptoms': 23.913978494623656,
       'Ascorbic Acid Treatment, No Cold Symptoms': 115.08602150537635,
       'Placebo Treatment, Cold Symptoms': 24.086021505376344,
       'Placebo Treatment, No Cold Symptoms': 115.91397849462365}
    

## Chi-squared Distribution


```python
arrVals = [
    abs(obs['a'] - aEXP) ** 2 / aEXP,
    abs(obs['b'] - bEXP) ** 2 / bEXP,
    abs(obs['c'] - cEXP) ** 2 / cEXP,
    abs(obs['d'] - dEXP) ** 2 / dEXP,
]

print("Chi-squared value: " + str(sum(arrVals)))
```

    Chi-squared value: 4.81141264632079
    

#### P-value (with 1 DF)


```python
from scipy import stats
pValueChiSq = 1 - stats.chi2.cdf(sum(arrVals) , 1) 

print("P-value: " + str(pValueChiSq))
```

    P-value: 0.0282718602468
    

Based on the p-value from the Chi-squared test (p < 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis that there is not a difference between Ascorbic Acid and placebo treatments.

## Fisher's Exact Test


```python
oddsRatio, pValueFET = stats.fisher_exact([
    [obs['a'], obs['c']], 
    [obs['b'], obs['d']]
], alternative = "less")

print("P-value: " + str(pValueFET))
```

    P-value: 0.0205227159928
    

Much like the Chi-squared test, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is not a difference between Ascorbic Acid and placebo treatments.

#### Difference from Chi-squared test (|Chi-squared p-value - Fisher's p-value|)


```python
print(abs(pValueChiSq - pValueFET))
```

    0.00774914425407
    

## Relative Risk and Odds Ratio

For the purpose of clarity, weâ€™ll define the following variables:

* Exposed: treatment by Ascorbic Acid
* Nonexposed: treatment by Placebo
* Disease: presence of cold symptoms after 2 weeks
* Nondisease: non-presence of cold symptoms

We will also redefine the variables 'a', 'b', 'c', & 'd' as follows:

* a = Exposed group with diseased outcome (17)
* b = Exposed group with non-diseased outcome (122)
* c = Nonexposed group with diseased outcome (31)
* d = Nonexposed group with non-diseased outcome (109)

#### Relative Risk Ratio


```python
import math

a = obs['a']
b = obs['c']
c = obs['b']
d = obs['d']

## Relative Risk Ratio
rr = (a / (a + b)) / (c / (c + d))

## Standard Error of ln(Relative Risk)
se = math.sqrt(1 / a + 1 / c - 1 / (a + b) - 1 / (c + d))

## 95% Confidence Interval
lowBound = math.exp(math.log(rr) - 1.96 * se)
highBound = math.exp(math.log(rr) + 1.96 * se)

## Standard Normal Deviate
zScore = math.log(rr) / se

## Two-tailed P-value
pValue = stats.norm.sf(abs(zScore)) * 2

print("Relative Risk Ratio: " + str(rr))
print("95% Confidence Interval: [" 
      + str(lowBound) + ", " + str(highBound) + "]")
print("P-value: " + str(pValue))
```

    Relative Risk Ratio: 0.5523323276862382
    95% Confidence Interval: [0.32091461822682626, 0.9506298026962117]
    P-value: 0.0321321040704
    

Because the Relative Risk ratio is 0.55 (< 1.0) at a 95% CI, we can say that (based on the RR ratio) there is a decreased chance that a risk exists between taking Ascorbic Acid and developing cold symptoms. This is further evidenced by the reported CIs [0.3209, 0.9506] not breaching 1.0.

#### Odds Ratio


```python
odds = (a * d) / (b * c)

## Standard Error of ln(Odds Ratio)
se = math.sqrt(1 / a + 1 / b + 1 / c + 1 / d)

## 95% Confidence Interval
lowBound = math.exp(math.log(odds) - 1.96 * se)
highBound = math.exp(math.log(odds) + 1.96 * se)

## Standard Normal Deviate
zScore = math.log(odds) / se

## Two-tailed P-value
pValue = stats.norm.sf(abs(zScore)) * 2

print("Odds Ratio: " + str(odds))
print("95% Confidence Interval: [" 
      + str(lowBound) + ", " + str(highBound) + "]")
print("P-value: " + str(pValue))
```

    Odds Ratio: 0.48995240613432045
    95% Confidence Interval: [0.25693886701875085, 0.9342820066973032]
    P-value: 0.030279474415
    

Much like the Relative Risk ratio above, we can say that there is a decreased chance that a risk exists between
Ascorbic Acid and cold symptoms (based on the ratio = 0.49 and the confidence interval at 95% [0.2569,
0.9342] not breaching 1.0).
