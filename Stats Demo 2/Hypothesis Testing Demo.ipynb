For a test example, we'll look at a hypothetical scenario where the effect of ascorbic acid is evaluated against the common cold. The data is based on a 1961 experiment where 279 French skiers were given either ascorbic acid or a placebo. After two weeks, they were examined to determine if they still had symptoms of the cold. \n",
