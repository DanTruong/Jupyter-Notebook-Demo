# Hypothesis Testing Demo
# Code by Dan Truong

# Experimental Context: look at a hypothetical scenario where the effect of 
# ascorbic acid is evaluated against the common cold. The data is based on a 
# 1961 experiment where 279 French skiers were given either ascorbic acid or 
# a placebo. After two weeks, the skiers were examined to determine if they 
# still had symptoms of the cold.

# Relative Risk and Odds Ratio

# For the purpose of clarity, weâ€™ll define the following variables:
# 	Exposed: treatment by Ascorbic Acid
# 	Nonexposed: treatment by Placebo
# 	Disease: presence of cold symptoms after 2 weeks
# 	Nondisease: non-presence of cold symptoms

# We will also redefine the variables 'a', 'b', 'c', & 'd' as follows:
# 	a = Exposed group with diseased outcome (17)
# 	b = Exposed group with non-diseased outcome (122)
# 	c = Nonexposed group with diseased outcome (31)
# 	d = Nonexposed group with non-diseased outcome (109)
